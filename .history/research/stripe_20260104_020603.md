# ResearchDocumenter Brief: stripe

**Generated:** 2026-01-04T02:06:03.688626
**Research Focus:** payment processing and webhooks

---

## 📚 Overview

This research brief provides implementation guidance for integrating **stripe**.

---

## ✨ Capabilities

- Stripe provides core functionality for stripe integration
- Authentication and authorization support
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting compliance
- Specialized support for payment intents
- Specialized support for webhooks
- Specialized support for idempotency

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Limitations

- Requires API credentials (environment variables recommended)
- Subject to rate limits (check official documentation)
- May require specific Python version compatibility
- Network errors must be handled gracefully
- Costs may apply for API usage
- Must use idempotency keys for safe retries
- Webhook signature verification required for security
- PCI compliance: Never store raw credit card data

---

## 💻 Minimal Working Example

```python
# Minimal Stripe Payment Example
import stripe
from os import getenv

stripe.api_key = getenv("STRIPE_API_KEY")

# Create payment intent
intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
    amount=1000,  # $10.00
    currency="usd",
    idempotency_key="unique_key_123"  # CRITICAL for safety
)

print(f"Payment Intent: {intent.id}")
```

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### Not handling rate limits

**Risk:** API calls fail unexpectedly

**Mitigation:** Implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Hardcoding credentials

**Risk:** Security breach if code is exposed

**Mitigation:** Always use environment variables (.env file)

### Not validating responses

**Risk:** Crashes on unexpected API changes

**Mitigation:** Validate response structure, handle None/empty cases

### Not using idempotency keys

**Risk:** Duplicate charges on retry

**Mitigation:** Always include idempotency_key for payment operations

---

## 🎯 5-Step Integration Plan

**Step 1: Setup** - Install stripe library and configure credentials

**Step 2: Authentication** - Verify API access with minimal test call

**Step 3: Core Integration** - Implement payment processing and webhooks functionality

**Step 4: Error Handling** - Add retry logic, rate limit handling, validation

**Step 5: Testing** - Write unit tests and integration tests with mocked responses
