2. **Competitor Analysis** - Google vs Motion vs Superhuman comparison
3. **Failure Lessons** - Why Sunrise/Mailbox failed, lessons to avoid
4. **Solo Success Benchmarks** - Build time, Year 1 revenue for solo founders
5. **Market Gaps** - Unmet needs and underserved niches
6. **Build & Launch** - Realistic build time, validation methods, APIs to leverage

**Sources:** 40-60 verifiable URLs per analysis

## üéØ **OPTIMIZED FOR YOUR CONTEXT**

### **Ambitious Solo Founder:**
- ‚úÖ Can build products yourself (low cost)
- ‚úÖ Can launch quickly (weeks not months)  
- ‚úÖ Can charge if addressing real pain points
- ‚úÖ Target smaller niches profitably

### **Analysis Focuses On:**
- **Pain Validation:** Are people currently paying competitors?
- **Build Feasibility:** Can YOU build MVP in 2-4 weeks?
- **Quick Validation:** How to test demand in 1 week
- **Realistic Revenue:** $12K-60K Year 1 is excellent for solo
- **Niche Opportunities:** Too small for VC, perfect for you

### **What Changed:**
- ‚ùå Not asking: "Can this be a $1B company?"
- ‚úÖ Now asking: "Can you build and charge for this in 4 weeks?"
- ‚ùå Not analyzing: Massive TAM and VC metrics
- ‚úÖ Now analyzing: Real pain points and solo feasibility

## üí° **EXAMPLE RESULTS**

### **Your Personal Assistant Idea:**
**Original:** "Email, calendar, life coaching, fitness, diet, journaling, voice interaction"

**Workshop Analysis:**
- **Initial Viability:** 24-33/50 (too broad, scope creep)
- **Biggest Risk:** Scope too large for solo founder
- **Solution:** Narrow to ONE feature (email management)
- **Final Viability:** 40-45/50
- **Recommendation:** GO - but start with email only

**Key Insights:**
- Motion.ai charges $34/month for AI calendar
- Superhuman charges $30/month for email enhancement
- Sunrise Calendar failed despite $30M funding (lesson: don't compete with Google)
- Solo founders can build email tools in 2-3 weeks
- Year 1 revenue realistic: 100 users √ó $25/month = $30K
