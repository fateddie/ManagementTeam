# Round 3: Opportunity Capture Prompt

**Why:** Optimizing for the biggest opportunity maximizes potential success. This round identifies strategies to capture maximum value from the best opportunity.

---

## Prompt Template

```
BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED:
{opportunity_description}
Potential Value: ${potential_value}
Probability: {probability}%

CURRENT IDEA STATE (after risk mitigation):
{current_idea_json}

YOUR TASK: Generate 5+ strategies to capture this opportunity, evaluate them, and finalize the evolved idea.

STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS:

For each strategy, provide:
1. Strategy name (concise, actionable)
2. How it captures the opportunity (specific mechanism)
3. Revenue impact (% increase or $value)
4. Implementation cost ($0-$X)
5. Time to value (weeks)
6. ROI (revenue_impact / cost)
7. Overall score (calculated: revenue_impact Ã— probability / (cost + time))

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Prioritize high ROI opportunities
- Consider speed to market
- Look for sustainable competitive advantages
- Favor strategies that compound over time
