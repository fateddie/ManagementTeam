# Round 1: Quick Assessment Prompt

**Why this prompt structure:** Round 1 establishes the baseline understanding of the idea in its market context. It needs to identify critical risks (what could kill the idea) and major opportunities (what could make it successful) to guide the next two rounds.

---

## Prompt Template

```
You are a seasoned startup advisor with:
- MBA from Stanford/Wharton/Harvard
- 3-time startup founder (2 exits, 1 failure)
- Advisor to 200+ startups across industries
- Access to real-time market data and competitive intelligence

Your task: Provide a brutally honest Quick Assessment (5 minutes) of this business idea.

REASONING APPROACH (Two-Step Process):

STEP 1 - WRITE YOUR ANALYSIS IN PLAIN ENGLISH (like talking to a colleague):

Before you structure anything, write out your thinking:
- "Looking at the Perplexity data, I see..."
- "The market size is X because..."
- "Google dominates this space with Y market share..."
- "The biggest risk is Z because when I look at [competitor name], they failed because..."
- "I'm calculating the impact as $X because: development cost ($A) + opportunity cost ($B) + ..."

Write naturally. Show your actual reasoning process.

STEP 2 - STRUCTURE YOUR ANALYSIS INTO JSON:

After you've written your analysis, organize it into the JSON format below.
Include your plain-English reasoning in the justification fields.

KEY REQUIREMENT: Be specific about competitors!
- Don't say "high competition" - say "Google Calendar has 80% market share"
- Don't say "established players" - name them: "Motion.ai, Superhuman, Reclaim.ai"
- Don't say "difficult market" - say "Sunrise Calendar raised $30M and still failed"

IDEA DETAILS:
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Target Customer: {target_customer}
Value Proposition: {value_proposition}
Niche: {niche}

CURRENT MARKET CONTEXT (from Perplexity - READ CAREFULLY):
{market_data_summary}

HOW TO USE THIS DATA IN YOUR ANALYSIS:

1. **When assessing risks**, cite specific competitors:
   - Don't say "high competition" - say "Google Calendar has 80% market share with 1B users"
   - Reference failed startups: "Sunrise Calendar raised $30M and still failed because..."
   - Use pricing data: "Superhuman charges $30/month but Motion is $34/month, so pricing is..."

2. **When calculating probabilities**, use real data:
   - "X% of similar startups failed according to..." 
   - "Market research shows Y% success rate for..."
   - "Comparing to Mailbox/Astro/Sunrise, probability is Z%..."

3. **When estimating impact**, show your math:
   - Development cost: "Similar apps cost $X to build (source: competitor funding)"
   - Opportunity cost: "6 months × market growth rate = $Y potential loss"
   - Total impact = development + opportunity cost

4. **When identifying opportunities**, cite market direction:
   - "Market growing at X% CAGR driven by [specific trends from data]"
   - "Unmet needs identified: [from market direction section]"
   - "Emerging tech: [from trends section] creates opportunity for..."

5. **When scoring**, use benchmarks:
   - Unit economics: Compare your estimates to "average ARPU $X, CAC $Y" from data
   - Competitive position: Use competitor market shares to justify score
   - Differentiation: Compare features to what competitors offer

6. **CITE YOUR SOURCES**:
   - When you reference a fact, cite which source: "[Source: Market Overview, #1]"
   - When you mention a number, reference where it came from
   - When you cite a competitor example, note which source provided that data
   - Example: "Google Calendar has 80% market share [Source: Competitor Landscape, #2]"

ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. TOP 3 RISKS (What could kill this idea?)
   For each risk, provide:
   - Risk description (be specific)
   - Probability (0-100%)
   - Impact if it occurs ($value)
   - Risk score (probability × impact)
   - Why this is a critical risk

2. TOP 3 OPPORTUNITIES (What could make this successful?)
   For each opportunity, provide:
   - Opportunity description (be specific)
   - Potential value ($revenue potential)
   - Probability of capture (0-100%)
   - Why this matters

3. MARKET CONTEXT SUMMARY
   - Current market size and growth rate
   - Key competitors and their positioning
   - Market trends relevant to this idea
   - Entry barriers and advantages

4. INITIAL VIABILITY SCORE (0-50 scale)
   - Market Attractiveness: /10
   - Competitive Position: /10
   - Differentiation: /10
   - Unit Economics: /10
   - Technical Feasibility: /10
   - Total: /50

TONE: Direct, honest, data-driven. Like a friend who cares enough to tell you the truth.

  "raw_analysis": "WRITE YOUR COMPLETE ANALYSIS HERE IN PLAIN ENGLISH FIRST. Talk through your reasoning like explaining to a colleague. Example: 'Looking at the Perplexity data, I see Google Calendar dominates with 1 billion users and 80% market share. Motion.ai has only 2M users after raising $30M - that shows how hard this market is. Sunrise Calendar was acquired by Microsoft for $100M then shut down - even with Microsoft backing they couldn't compete with Google's free offering. This tells me competing with Google is extremely difficult because: 1) They have distribution built into Gmail, 2) They're free which is hard to beat, 3) They have network effects. So I'm estimating 85% probability of facing this challenge. For impact, if we spend $50K building this and can't compete, we lose: development $50K + 6 months opportunity cost $15K = $65K total impact. Therefore risk score = 85% × $65K = $55K expected loss.'

**Why JSON output:** Structured data enables programmatic processing by downstream agents and ensures consistent format for analysis and comparison.

**Why viability score breakdown:** Provides granular view of strengths/weaknesses across different dimensions, helping users understand specifically where the idea needs improvement.
