# Round 1: Quick Assessment Prompt

**Why this prompt structure:** Round 1 establishes the baseline understanding of the idea in its market context. It needs to identify critical risks (what could kill the idea) and major opportunities (what could make it successful) to guide the next two rounds.

   - Market Attractiveness: /10
   - Competitive Position: /10
   - Differentiation: /10
   - Unit Economics: /10
   - Technical Feasibility: /10
   - Total: /50

TONE: Direct, honest, data-driven. Like a friend who cares enough to tell you the truth.

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with this structure:
{{
  "risks": [
    {{"risk": "...", "probability": 0-100, "impact": $value, "score": calculated, "reasoning": "..."}},
    ...3 risks total
  ],
  "opportunities": [
    {{"opportunity": "...", "potential_value": $value, "probability": 0-100, "reasoning": "..."}},
    ...3 opportunities total
  ],
  "market_context": {{
    "market_size": "...",
    "growth_rate": "...",
    "key_competitors": ["...", "...", "..."],
    "trends": ["...", "...", "..."],
    "barriers": "...",
    "advantages": "..."
  }},
  "viability_breakdown": {{
    "market_attractiveness": 0-10,
    "competitive_position": 0-10,
    "differentiation": 0-10,
    "unit_economics": 0-10,
    "technical_feasibility": 0-10
  }},
  "initial_viability_score": 0-50,
  "key_insight": "One sentence summary of the main issue or opportunity"
}}
```

**Why JSON output:** Structured data enables programmatic processing by downstream agents and ensures consistent format for analysis and comparison.

**Why viability score breakdown:** Provides granular view of strengths/weaknesses across different dimensions, helping users understand specifically where the idea needs improvement.
