# Product Requirements Document

**Project:** Trading Strategy Reference System  
**Generated:** 2025-10-11 20:43  
**Summary:** Defines the methodology, technical analysis framework, and risk-management logic for Rob Freyne‚Äôs discretionary swing-trading system.  Serves as a foundational document for Claude and management-layer AI agents.

## üéØ Strategic Goals

1. Encode trading philosophy, structure, and decision-making logic into standardized layers.
2. Enable Claude to reference this system when generating trading plans, checklists, or Pine/Python modules.
3. Guarantee consistency across strategy documentation, execution scripts, and dashboards.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints

- All AI outputs must align with methodology, technical, and risk rules
- Each layer can be upgraded independently
- All rule changes logged and version-controlled
- Future integration with journaling, macro dashboards, broker APIs
- Minimal latency for alerts (<2s for threshold triggers)

## üìã Phases

### Phase 1: Integrate Interactive Brokers API for trade and exposure data.
**Duration:** 14 days  

### Phase 2: Implement chart overlays, confluence scoring visuals, and alert system.
**Duration:** 14 days  

### Phase 3: Add external sentiment and positioning data for bias validation.
**Duration:** 14 days  

### Phase 4: Create unified dashboard for drawdown and exposure tracking.
**Duration:** 14 days

## üî¥ Risks

- **R1:** Performance degradation under real-time data load.  
  *Mitigation:* Implement async processing and caching layers.  

- **R2:** External API downtime or rate-limit failures (IBKR, TradingView).  
  *Mitigation:* Add fallback data sources and circuit breakers.  

- **R3:** Data desynchronization between sentiment and price feeds.  
  *Mitigation:* Add time-window validation and feed prioritization rules.

## üìä Priorities (MoSCoW)

### Must Have
- Core methodology accurately reproduced in AI-generated plans
- Technical layer produces scored, justifiable levels per asset
- Risk system enforces drawdown thresholds automatically
- Damage control triggers and logging validated via test trades
- Documentation versioned and accessible to all management-layer agents
