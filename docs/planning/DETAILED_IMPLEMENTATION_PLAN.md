# 🚀 Detailed Implementation Plan: Iterative Workshop Integration

**Project:** AI Management Team — Workshop Agent Integration  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Rob Freyne  
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Governance:** Following `claude.md` phase-gated development model

---

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This plan addresses the **5 critical gaps** identified in the system analysis by implementing a complete Iterative Workshop Agent integration into the existing AI Management Team workflow. The implementation follows the established phase-gated development model with sequential completion and user approval gates.

### **Critical Gaps Being Addressed:**

1. **Workshop Agent Integration Gap** - Missing IterativeWorkshopAgent in workflow
2. **User Interaction Gap** - No interactive decision points during workshops
3. **Perplexity Integration Gap** - Real-time data not systematically used
4. **Data Persistence Gap** - Workshop results not properly stored/shared
5. **Validation & Testing Gap** - No systematic testing of workshop methodology

---
