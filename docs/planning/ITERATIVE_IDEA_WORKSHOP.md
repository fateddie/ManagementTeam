### **Example Flow:**

```
User: "I want to build a voice-first productivity app"

AI: "Great! I see 3 big risks: 1) Voice UX complexity, 2) Email API hell, 3) Crowded market.
     Let's brainstorm solutions for risk #1..."

User: "I like solution 3 - start with text interface"

AI: "Perfect! Now your idea is: Text-first productivity app.
     Let's tackle risk #2 - email integration..."

[Continue for 5 rounds]

AI: "Final idea: Text-first email triage for entrepreneurs.
     Viability: 42/50. Recommendation: GO after validation."
```
