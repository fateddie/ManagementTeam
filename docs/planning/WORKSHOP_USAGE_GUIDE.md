## üéØ **What to Look For**

### **In the Analysis:**
1. **Specific competitor names** - Not "established players", but "Google Calendar, Motion.ai"
2. **Actual numbers** - "80% market share", "$30M funding", "2M users"
3. **Real examples** - "Sunrise Calendar failed because..."
4. **Calculations shown** - "70% √ó $65K = $45.5K"
