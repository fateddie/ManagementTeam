## ‚úÖ **COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST**

### **OpenAI Best Practices (Official Guidance)**

#### **1. Write Clear Instructions** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Clearly articulate request, specify format/style/length  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Clear task definition: "Provide a brutally honest Quick Assessment"
- ‚úÖ Specified format: JSON with exact structure
- ‚úÖ Defined output requirements: "Return valid JSON only"

**Evidence in Our Prompts:**
```
Your task: Provide a brutally honest Quick Assessment (5 minutes) of this business idea.
OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with this structure (INCLUDE DETAILED REASONING)
```

---

#### **2. Provide Reference Texts** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Include specific materials/examples for context  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time market data from Perplexity included
- ‚úÖ Refined idea details provided as context
- ‚úÖ Previous round results fed into subsequent rounds

**Evidence in Our Prompts:**
```
CURRENT MARKET CONTEXT (from Perplexity):
{market_data_summary}

IDEA DETAILS:
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
...
```

---

#### **3. Break Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Decompose intricate tasks into manageable parts  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ 3 separate rounds instead of one massive analysis
- ‚úÖ Each round has specific focus (Assessment / Risk / Opportunity)
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step reasoning required in each round

**Evidence in Our Design:**
- Round 1: Market assessment ONLY
- Round 2: Risk mitigation ONLY
- Round 3: Opportunity capture ONLY

---

#### **4. Give the Model Time to "Think" (Chain-of-Thought)** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Encourage step-by-step reasoning before answering  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit CoT instructions in all 3 rounds
- ‚úÖ "Think step-by-step" directive
- ‚úÖ Request reasoning for each decision
- ‚úÖ Lower temperature (0.4) for analytical consistency

**Evidence in Our Prompts:**
```
REASONING APPROACH (Chain-of-Thought):
Think step-by-step through your analysis:
1. First, analyze the market context from real-time data
2. Then, identify critical risks by asking "what could kill this idea?"
3. Next, identify major opportunities by asking "what could make this successful?"
4. Finally, score viability objectively across 5 dimensions
5. For each risk/opportunity, explain your reasoning with specific evidence
```

---

#### **5. Specify Desired Output Format** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Define structure (JSON, bullet points, tables, etc.)  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit JSON schema with all fields defined
- ‚úÖ Structured format for consistency
- ‚úÖ JSON mode enabled in API calls (`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`)

**Evidence in Our Code:**
```python
response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.model,
    messages=[...],
    temperature=0.4,
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}  # ‚úÖ Using JSON mode
)
```

---

#### **6. Assign a Role or Persona** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Instruct AI to respond from specific perspective/role  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Specific persona: MBA + startup founder
- ‚úÖ 15+ years experience, 3-time founder
- ‚úÖ Role defined in system message and persona spec

**Evidence in Our Prompts:**
```
You are a seasoned startup advisor with:
- MBA from Stanford/Wharton/Harvard
- 3-time startup founder (2 exits, 1 failure)
- Advisor to 200+ startups across industries
```

---

#### **7. Iterative Refinement** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**
**Best Practice:** Treat prompt engineering as iterative process  
**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Prompts separated into files for easy iteration
- ‚úÖ Tested with multiple real ideas
- ‚úÖ Refined based on output quality
- ‚úÖ Added numerical justification based on user feedback

**Our Iteration History:**
1. Initial prompts created
2. Added Chain-of-Thought reasoning
3. Enhanced with numerical justifications (current)
4. Testing with real ideas ongoing

---

## üìä **TEMPERATURE SETTINGS VALIDATION**

### **OpenAI Recommendations:**
- **Creative tasks:** 0.7-1.0
- **Analytical tasks:** 0.2-0.5
- **Structured outputs:** 0.3-0.6

### **Our Settings:** ‚úÖ **OPTIMAL**
- **Workshop rounds:** 0.4 (analytical reasoning)
- **Why:** Workshop is analytical decision-making, not creative writing
- **Validation:** 0.4 is within recommended range for analytical tasks

**Evidence:**
```python
temperature=0.4,  # Lower for consistent analytical reasoning with CoT
```

---

## üéØ **ENHANCEMENTS MADE FOR NUMBER JUSTIFICATION**

### **New Requirements Added:**

**Round 1 - Risk Assessment:**
- `probability_justification`: "WHY this probability? What evidence/data led to this specific %?"
- `impact_justification`: "WHY this dollar amount? How did I calculate this? Show your math."
- `score_calculation`: "Show calculation: probability(X%) √ó impact($Y) = score(Z)"

**Round 1 - Opportunity Assessment:**
- `value_justification`: "WHY this dollar amount? Show calculation based on market size, pricing, capture rate"
- `probability_justification`: "WHY this probability of capture? What evidence supports this %?"

**Round 1 - Viability Scoring:**
- Each dimension now includes `reasoning` field
- Added `viability_calculation`: "Show how you calculated the total score"

**Round 2 - Solutions:**
- `why_this_score`: "How did I calculate this score? What factors did I weigh?"
- `tradeoff_analysis`: "What do you gain vs sacrifice?"
- Added cost/time justification requirements

**Round 3 - Strategies:**
- `revenue_justification`: "Show calculation: market size √ó capture rate √ó pricing"
- `cost_justification`: "Break down all cost components"
- `roi_calculation`: "Show math: $revenue / $cost = X:1 ROI"
- `time_justification`: "What factors determine this duration?"

## üîç **PERPLEXITY QUERY OPTIMIZATION**

### **Current Queries:**
```python
queries = [
    f"What's the current market size for {industry} in 2025?",
    f"Who are the top 3 competitors in {industry} and their revenue?",
    f"Latest trends in {industry} industry",
    f"Recent funding activity and investor interest in {industry} space"
]
```

### **Best Practices Applied:** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Specific and focused:** Each query asks one clear question
- ‚úÖ **Time-bound:** Includes "2025", "latest", "recent" for current data
- ‚úÖ **Quantifiable:** Asks for specific metrics (market size, revenue)
- ‚úÖ **Research focus:** Uses focus="research" parameter

## üöÄ **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

**Latest Enhancement (Just Added):**
- ‚úÖ All probabilities must be justified
- ‚úÖ All dollar amounts must show calculation
- ‚úÖ All scores must explain formula
- ‚úÖ All timelines must justify duration

**Why This Matters:**
- Users can trust the analysis (transparency)
- Decisions are explainable (accountability)
- Assumptions are visible (can be challenged)
- Calculations can be verified (evidence-based)

---

**Our prompts now exceed industry best practices by requiring full justification for all numerical values, making the workshop analysis completely transparent and evidence-based.**
