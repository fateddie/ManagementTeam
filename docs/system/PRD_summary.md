## 🎯 1. PROJECT SNAPSHOT
| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Build a Claude-Code–driven multi-agent framework that acts as an AI "executive team," capable of structured reasoning, memory retention, and human-approved decision-making. |
| **Core Agents** | Strategy • Financial • Technical • Operations • Data |
| **Coordinator** | `orchestrator.py` (manages workflow, logging, memory updates) |
| **Oversight** | Founder-in-loop approvals via Slack and dashboard interface |
| **Vision** | A scalable, auditable AI management engine for trading, analytics, and SME automation projects. |

---

## 🧩 2. CURRENT STATUS (v1.0)
| Area | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Architecture & Governance | ✅ Complete |
| Orchestrator + Memory | ✅ Operational |
| Maintenance Automation | ✅ Functional |
| Slack Monitoring | 🕓 In progress (Phase 2) |
| Dashboard Interface | 🔜 Planned |
| Vector Memory | 🔜 Planned |
| Hybrid Learning | 🔜 Future (Q1 2026) |

---

## ⚙️ 3. KEY COMPONENTS
| Module | Function |
|---------|-----------|
| **`orchestrator.py`** | Controls multi-agent workflow and decision sequence |
| **`memory_manager.py`** | JSON-based persistent memory (per-agent) |
| **`maintenance_tasks.py`** | Weekly cleanup, summarization, dependency sync |
| **`.claude/` Folder** | Defines Claude's behaviour, config, and operational rules |
| **Docs System** | Charter, Rules, TDRs, PRD, Change Log, File Structure |
| **Setup Scripts** | Cross-platform (`.sh` + `.bat`) automated environment creation |

---

## 🧱 4. SYSTEM VALUE
✅ **Transparency** – Every action logged and auditable  
✅ **Continuity** – Agents remember and evolve  
✅ **Governance** – Human oversight built in  
✅ **Reusability** – Modular structure for future AI projects  
✅ **Compliance** – GDPR-aligned, no PII in data paths

| Phase | Focus | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Validate orchestration & memory | Week 1 |
| **2** | Slack monitoring (webhook alerts) | Week 2 |
| **3** | Vector memory integration | Week 3 |
| **4** | FastAPI + React dashboard | Week 4-5 |
| **5** | Hybrid memory + LangChain inside agents | Week 6 |
| **6** | Cloud deployment & scaling | Q1 2026 |

## 📈 6. SUCCESS METRICS
| KPI | Target |
|------|---------|
| End-to-end setup time | < 5 minutes |
| Agent run reliability | 100 % pass rate |
| Log & memory integrity | 0 data loss |
| Human-approval latency | < 3 seconds (Slack) |
| Maintenance pass rate | 100 % clean cycle |

## 🧠 8. NEXT MILESTONES
- ✅ Validate orchestrator + memory across 5 agents  
- 🔔 Implement Slack Webhook (Phase 2 Monitoring Plan)  
- 🧩 Draft `TDR_vector_memory_integration.md`  
- 🧮 Begin dashboard prototype (FastAPI + React)  
- 🔁 Schedule weekly maintenance via cron/task scheduler
