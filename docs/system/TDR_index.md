# TECHNOLOGY DECISION RECORDS ‚Äì INDEX

## üéØ PURPOSE
This index provides a centralized reference for all Technology Decision Records (TDRs).  
Each TDR documents a key architectural or technology-related choice, its rationale, and its review plan.  
The goal is to ensure **traceability**, **clarity**, and **accountability** for every major decision in the system's evolution.

## üìö CURRENT DECISIONS
| ID | Title | Status | Date | Next Review | File |
|----|--------|--------|------|--------------|------|
| TDR-001 | JSON-Based Memory Over ChromaDB | Accepted | 2025-10-08 | Q1 2026 | `TDR_001_json_memory.md` |

## üß© HOW TO ADD A NEW DECISION
When a new architectural or technology choice arises:
1. Copy `TDR_template.md` (see below or separate file).
2. Save as `TDR_XXX_<topic>.md` with next sequential ID.
3. Add entry to this index with unique ID (`TDR-XXX`).
4. Reference affected files and planned review date.
5. Update `change_log.md` with the new decision.
