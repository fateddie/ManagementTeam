2. **Test persistence** across sessions (shutdown → rerun).
3. **Record success** in `change_log.md` under "Persistent Memory Activated."
4. **Prepare for Slack Webhook integration (Phase 1)** – scheduled next.

---

## 8️⃣ REVIEW CYCLE

- **Weekly (Founder + Strategy Agent):** progress review.
- **Monthly:** architecture audit and improvement log.
- **Quarterly:** version updates to Charter, Rules, and System Context.

## 9️⃣ VERSION CONTROL

| File                              | Version | Maintainer          |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| `project_progress_plan.md`        | 1.0     | Founder             |
| `memory_manager.py`               | 1.0     | Technical Architect |
| `orchestrator.py`                 | 1.0     | Founder             |
