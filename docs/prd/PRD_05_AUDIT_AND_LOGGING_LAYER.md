# 📘 PRD‑05 — Audit & Logging Layer

## 1️⃣ Objective
Implement a transparent logging and version control subsystem that records
who did what, when, and why. This layer underpins compliance, data integrity,
and reproducibility across all SOP phases.

---

## 2️⃣ Scope

### Included
- Unified log schema for all actions.  
- Versioning and backup of artifact files.  
- Time‑stamped, human‑readable audit records.  
- Support for both JSON and CSV exports.

### Excluded
- Analytics visualization (handled in PRD‑07).  
- External log shipping (future enhancement).

## 3️⃣ Functional Overview

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Action Logging** | Record timestamp, phase, agent, action, comment. |
| **Version Control** | Auto‑copy artifact files into `/archive/<timestamp>/`. |
| **Change Detection** | Hash comparison to detect edits between versions. |
| **Export Utility** | Convert JSON logs to CSV for external analysis. |

---

## 4️⃣ Log Schema

```jsonc
{
  "timestamp": "2025‑10‑16T10:30:00Z",
  "user": "Rob",
  "agent": "Planner",
  "phase": 4,
  "action": "approved",
  "comment": "Pain validation complete.",
  "file_changed": "/templates/pain_scores.json",
  "hash": "sha256‑..."
}
```

---

## 5️⃣ Directory Layout

```
/logs/
 ├── audit_trail.json
 ├── audit_trail.csv
 └── /archive/
      └── 2025‑10‑16_103000/
           ├── pain_scores.json
           ├── market_competition.md
```

---

## 6️⃣ Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|----|--------------|--------------|
| AL‑1 | Every agent action recorded with timestamp and hash | Log review |
| AL‑2 | Modified artifacts archived automatically | File diff check |
| AL‑3 | Export to CSV works | Manual test |
| AL‑4 | Log entries readable and self‑contained | Visual check |

---

## 7️⃣ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Log corruption | High | Write‑once JSON append + checksum |
| File bloat | Medium | Compress archives periodically |
| Human overwrite | Low | Lock audit files after session |
