    A modular AI-assisted trading application integrating Interactive Brokers for live data,
    TradingView for charting, and multi-agent analytics for discretionary swing trading.
    MVP focuses on 7 core agents (Market Data Collector, Risk Sentiment Engine, Portfolio, Macro,
    Sentiment, COT, Technical, Risk Manager). The Risk Sentiment Engine (RSE) provides cross-asset
    risk regime scoring (-100 to +100) from equities, volatility, USD, rates, commodities, and gold.
    Future phases include voice interface, Trade Planner, Mentor, and Coordinator agents.

project:
  overview:
    summary: >
      Build a professional-grade AI Trading Copilot that provides deep market insight, performance analytics,
      and structured top-down analysis for discretionary trading. The system uses modular agents with
      persistent memory, structured workflows, and human-in-the-loop decision support. Phase 1 (MVP) delivers
      core analytics via Next.js dashboard. Phase 2 adds voice interface and advanced planning/mentoring agents.
