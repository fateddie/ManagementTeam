## Overview

Build a professional-grade AI Trading Copilot for discretionary swing FX trading. The system integrates Interactive Brokers for live data, Alpha Vantage for historical data, and TradingView for charting. Core architecture includes 7 specialized agents: 1) Market Data Collector fetches and caches data from IBKR and TradingView, 2) Risk Sentiment Engine (RSE) computes cross-asset risk regime scores from -100 (risk-off) to +100 (risk-on) using 7 weighted components: Equities (SPX/NDX 25%), Volatility (VIX 20% inverted), USD (DXY 15% inverted), Rates (UST10Y 15% inverted), Curve (UST10Y-UST2Y 10%), Oil (BRENT 10%), Gold (XAU 5% inverted). RSE uses rolling z-scores for normalization, hysteresis to prevent whipsawing, and pair-specific weight overrides for JPY crosses, CHF, and commodity FX pairs. 3) Portfolio Agent calculates drawdown, win rate, expectancy, and per-pair performance. 4) Macro Agent analyzes economic calendar events and policy shifts, weighted by RSE regime. 5) Sentiment Agent scores news sentiment (hawkish/dovish bias) filtered by RSE regime. 6) COT Agent analyzes CFTC positioning data contextualized with RSE. 7) Technical Agent detects support/resistance with RSE confluence scoring. 8) Risk Manager monitors damage control levels adjusted by RSE volatility component. Frontend is Next.js with Tailwind, backend is FastAPI with WebSocket support, database is Supabase for persistence. MVP timeline is 15 days: M1 (3 days) Data Integration, M2 (6 days) 7-Agent Analytics including RSE on Day 4, M3 (4 days) Dashboard, M4 (2 days) Testing. Phase-gate criteria enforced with 100% checklist completion before proceeding. System is human-in-loop only, no automated trade execution.
